## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your application, consider the following:

- **Database**: Set up your production database and update the connection string.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure environment-specific settings.
- **HTTPS**: Ensure HTTPS is enforced in production.
- **Freighter Network Configuration**: Set the Stellar network to `PublicNet` if deploying to production.
